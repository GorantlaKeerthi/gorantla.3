Program for solving Problem 1 (Partition the n integers into n/2 pairs)
is in bin_addr1_1

Program for solving Problem 2 (Divide the n integers into n/log n groups of log n numbers each)
is in bin_addr1_2

Both programs compile with make,
and are executed the following way:
  $ ./master 100.txt
Result = 100

$ ./master 646.txt
Result = 646
